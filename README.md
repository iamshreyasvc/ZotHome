# ZotHome
A easy to access website for UCI students, where all campus resources are pooled together. 
*Work in Process!*

Basic Functions are run via Flask on Python v3.9.7 and several HTML files with CSS styling. 
As a result, HTML files have to be put in a seperate folder called templates. 

There are still a lot features to be added 
 HTML Templeates have not been included yet. 
 
 # Update: 03/29/2022:
 
 
 The basic HTML files of ZotHome were completely redone in order to make the User Interface much for friendlier and welcoming. A new SignIn and Create an Account Methods were created to enable UX personailzation. Plenty of new features were added too. From enabling web scrapping from important UCI websites and publishing them on the website and making sure the whole experience is more cohesive. 
 
 The Backend was redone as well to make sure, there were less bugs and easier to understand. Built in comapatability with NGROK to enable the publishing of this website in a manner that is free. Further advice on this is appreciated. 
 
 I also need to add that the w3Schools Web Templates proved to very helpful in designing this project, so Thank you!
 
 
 # Future Update Plans:
 
 As this was a experience gaining project, with no real intention of making an actual product out of, I think that this website has given me enough experience in UI Design and Web Backend Development. Therefore, I do not think, I will devote more time to this project, as I move onto more viable projects. However, if I do come back to this, I plan to add the following features:
 
 
 1. Encryption for the transmittion of Usernames and Passwords
 2. Additional features to make the After Sign In Page more usable
 3. Make sure cookies work on Iframes that enable users to login, when presented with Duo. 
 4. I also want to add some features with 3JS, with some cool designs, just for the fun of it. (No real Need). 
 

That about it, for this update! This was a pleasure to work on so far! Hopefully I get back to it to make it better. In the meantime, I hope that you find it useful for whatever you may use it for.
