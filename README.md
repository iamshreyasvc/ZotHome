A easy to access website for UCI students, where all campus resources are pooled together. 
*Work in Process!*

Basic Functions are run via Flask on Python v3.9.7 and several HTML files with CSS styling. 
As a result, HTML files have to be put in a seperate folder called templates. \

There are still a lot features to be added 
 HTML Templeates have not been included yet.
